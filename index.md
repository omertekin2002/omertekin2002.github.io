# About

Welcome to my personal CV website! This is where you can learn more about my professional background, skills, and experience.

This is the home page. It can be used for a short introduction. [Click here](cv) to see the full CV, and [here](assets/files/cv.pdf) to download a print version. The theme also ships with a blog: [click here](posts) to scroll posts from the most recent. Finally, [click here](404) to see a page that can't be found.

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).

Feel free to explore the different sections of this website to get a comprehensive view of my professional journey and accomplishments.

Below is a list of blog posts included for illustrative purposes. Make sure to delete or modify them before deploying your website.
